# Perceptron_Task

A simple perceptron classifier is implemented by using 2 properties, sepal length and petal lenght to classify the dataset into versicolor and setosa flowers.

The perceptron classifier uses a **unit step function** to create a line that seperates the data points into binary classes labelled 1 and -1. 

We can then define a decision function (𝜙𝜙(𝑧𝑧)) that
takes a linear combination of certain input values, **x**, and a corresponding weight
vector, **w**, where z is the so-called net input 𝑧𝑧 = 𝑤𝑤1𝑥𝑥1 + 𝑤𝑤2𝑥𝑥2 +. . . + 𝑤𝑤𝑚𝑚𝑥𝑥�
